### **Project Details:**

**1. Data Exploration:**
   - Performed initial analysis of the phone sales dataset to understand the structure and identify key variables like product name, sales revenue, customer demographics, and location.
   - Cleansed and transformed the data as needed to ensure it was ready for analysis.

**2. SQL Queries for Key Insights:**
   - Developed SQL queries to uncover important business insights, including:
     - **Top-Selling Products:** Queries to find the best-selling phones based on sales revenue and quantity.
     - **Customer Segmentation:** Segmented customers based on purchase behavior and demographics to identify key target groups.
     - **Sales Trends:** Analyzed sales patterns over time, identifying seasonal peaks and troughs in sales.
     - **Regional Analysis:** Evaluated sales performance by region, highlighting areas with the highest growth potential.

**3. Aggregation and Reporting:**
   - Used SQL aggregation functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, and `GROUP BY` to calculate total sales, average purchase amounts, and total revenue for each product, region, and demographic group.
   - The output of these queries can be used to generate strategic insights for marketing and sales teams.
